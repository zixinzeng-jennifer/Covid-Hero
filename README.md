# Covid-Hero
Class project of Python Programming and Application, written by a group of 4 members.

An original action game written in Python (uses Pygame Zero). This game pays respect to doctors who are fighting against the COVID-19 disease. 

In this game, the character is a doctor who gathers various types of immunes cells(cell B, cell T, etc.) to create a vaccine. The doctor can use 3 types of tools (mask: to ignore the damage of viruses in 3 secs, spray: to kill viruses in the vicinity, portal: to transfer to another location immediately) which randomly appear on the map to help complete the game. The doctor also needs to avoid the virus that are roaming around (when two viruses collide, they may mutate and become more dangerous).

There are 10 levels in total (with a tutorial level at the beginning of the game), and the game becomes harder as the level increases. When a player losts, he/she can see a ranking list of past players; when a player wins, there will be a summary of how long the player took to complete each level.

Includes poster and trailer video as well.
